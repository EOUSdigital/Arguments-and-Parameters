//  💻 Coding Challenge: “Smart Event Tracker”

//? 🧩 Scenario:
//  We are building a logging utility for a collaborative web app. Each user can perform various actions, and you want to track these in a clear, friendly format.

//? 🔧 Function Requirements:

//* 1. Function Name: `trackEvents`
//* 2. Parameters:
//  • `user` (string): The name of the user. If not provided, default it to `"Anonymous"`.
//  • `...events` (rest parameter): An unlimited number of strings representing activity descriptions (e.g., `"logged in"`, `"edited a document"`).
//* 3. Behavior:
//  • If no events are passed, log:
//      `"Anonymous has no recorded events."` *(Replace `"Anonymous"` with the user name, if given.)*
//  • If events are passed, log:
//      `"<User> has performed the following: <event1>, <event2>, <event3>."`
//* 4. Example Outputs:
//  •  `trackEvents("Lena", "joined a meeting", "shared a file")`
//      ➜ `Lena has performed the following: joined a meeting, shared a file.`
//  •   `trackEvents()`
//      ➜ `Anonymous has no recorded events.`

//* 🧠 Bonus Challenge (Optional):
//  Add logic that automatically pluralizes “event” based on how many events are passed, e.g.:
//  • `"Alex has 1 event."`
//  • `"Alex has 3 events: logged in, updated settings, signed out."`

//! Solution

function trackEvents(user = "Anonymous", ...events) {
    if (events.length === 0) {
        console.log(`${user} has no recorded events.`);
    } else {
        console.log(`${user} has performed the following: ${events.join(', ')}.`);
    } 
}

trackEvents("Lena", "joined a meeting", "shared a file");
trackEvents();

//TODO  🔠 Goal: Smartly Pluralize “event”
//  Update your trackEvents function so that the message adapts based on the number of events:

//* ✅ Behavior
//  1. If no events:
//  ➜ "Anonymous has no recorded events."
//  2. If 1 event:
//  ➜ "Lena has 1 event: joined a meeting."
//  3. If 2 or more events:
//  ➜ "Lena has 2 events: joined a meeting, shared a file."

//! Solution

function trackEvents2(user = "Anonymous", ...events) {
    if (events.length === 0) {
        console.log(`${user} has no recorded events.`);
    } else if (events.length === 1) {
        console.log(`${user} has 1 event: ${events[0]}.`);
    } else {
        console.log(`${user} has ${events.length} events: ${events.join(', ')}.`);
    } 
}

trackEvents2("Lena", "joined a meeting");
trackEvents2("Lena", "joined", "shared", "commented");
trackEvents2();
